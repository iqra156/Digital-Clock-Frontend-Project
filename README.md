# Digital-Clock-Frontend-Project

This project creates a digital clock that dynamically displays the current time, updating every second. The clock is styled with a visually appealing gradient background and a blur effect, making it look modern and sleek. The project consists of three main components:

# HTML (Structure)
CSS (Styling & Layout)
JavaScript (Functionality & Time Updates)
Step 1: Setting Up the HTML Structure
The HTML file provides the basic structure of the web page and includes:

# A container that acts as the main wrapper for the entire page. It takes up the full viewport height.
A centered clock inside a div class="container", which will display the time in HH:MM:SS format.
Three <span> elements that separately display hours (#hrs), minutes (#min), and seconds (#sec). These spans are dynamically updated using JavaScript.
A link to an external CSS file (style.css) for styling.
A script file (script.js) linked at the end of the body to handle the clock's functionality.
Step 2: Designing the Clock with CSS
The CSS file enhances the visual presentation of the digital clock. It includes:

# Background & Color Theme
The entire page has a gradient background that transitions between two shades of purple (#08001f and #30197d), giving it a futuristic look.
The text color is set to white (#fff) for contrast and better visibility.
Positioning & Layout

The clock container (.container) is positioned at the center of the page using transform: translate(-50%, -50%).
A blurry background effect is applied to the clock using backdrop-filter: blur(40px), giving it a stylish glass-like appearance.
Typography & Styling of Time Display

The clock digits are displayed in a large, bold font (80px).
Each time unit (HH, MM, SS) is placed inside a <span> with equal width for alignment.
A small label ("HOURS", "MINS", "SEC") is displayed below each number using the ::after pseudo-element.

# Decorative Elements
Two floating shapes (a square and a circle) are added behind the clock using the ::before and ::after pseudo-elements to enhance aesthetics.
A pink square (#f41b75) is positioned at the top-left.
A blue circle (#419aff) is positioned at the bottom-right.
Step 3: Making the Clock Functional with JavaScript
The JavaScript file (script.js) dynamically updates the time every second.

# Fetching Elements
It first selects the three <span> elements by their IDs (#hrs, #min, #sec) and stores them in variables (hrs, min, sec).
Updating the Time Every Second
A setInterval() function is used to execute the time update every 1000 milliseconds (1 second).
Getting the Current Time
Inside the setInterval(), JavaScriptâ€™s Date() object fetches the current hours, minutes, and seconds.
Formatting the Time Display
If a number is less than 10, a leading zero is added (e.g., 09 instead of 9) for a uniform two-digit display.
The updated values are inserted into the respective <span> elements (#hrs, #min, #sec).
